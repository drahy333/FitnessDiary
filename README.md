This bachelorâ€™s thesis is devoted to the development of a web application serving as a virtual notebook for individuals engaged in fitness, specifically those who train in gyms. The application primarily focuses on muscle mass gain through the planning and mo- nitoring of workouts. It allows for a detailed examination, recording, and tracking of individual progress, thereby enhancing efficiency in advancement. Besides traditional strength exercises, the application integrates tools for recording cardiovascular activi- ties, providing users with a comprehensive overview of their physical progress. Another key aspect of the application is the ability to meticulously record dietary habits and their nutritional values, including caloric intake. The application also focuses on moni- toring key regeneration factors such as sleep. The goal of this work is to provide a tool that supports fitness enthusiasts in all aspects of their training and lifestyle regimes, contributing to their overall health and condition.
